    content: The C64 is a function-rich, well made, handsome reproduction and includes
      a diverse and upgradable spread of games. From the colour palette to the crunchy
      audio, everything is in place to return you to a golden era of home computing.

    content: All pre-installed games load very quickly but you might have to wait for your own downloaded files to start. They are faster than on the original computer but still take a while to start up. There's no doubt that what the retro console does it does well, with excellent emulation of both the Commodore 64 and its software. It's a decent homage to a glorious period for gaming.

    content: A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these
      sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and
      feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of
      souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite
      sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.

Picture this: It’s 1982 and a new home computer graces the scene. Out goes the silent black and white experience and in with 64KB of RAM, colour graphics, and synthesizer sound.

Roll forward 35 years and kick nostalgia into overdrive with the release of THEC64 Mini. A tiny but perfectly formed 50% scale replica of this much-loved machine.

Featuring high-definition output via HDMI, a classic style joystick and 64 built-in games including classics like Uridium, Paradroid, California Games, Jumpman and Speedball 2.
