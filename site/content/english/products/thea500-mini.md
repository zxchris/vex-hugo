    content: The C64 is a function-rich, well made, handsome reproduction and includes
      a diverse and upgradable spread of games. From the colour palette to the crunchy
      audio, everything is in place to return you to a golden era of home computing.

    content: All pre-installed games load very quickly but you might have to wait for your own downloaded files to start. They are faster than on the original computer but still take a while to start up. There's no doubt that what the retro console does it does well, with excellent emulation of both the Commodore 64 and its software. It's a decent homage to a glorious period for gaming.

    content: A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these
      sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and
      feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of
      souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite
      sense of mere tranquil existence, that I neglect my talents.
